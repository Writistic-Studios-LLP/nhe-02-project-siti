# Observation Protocols

NHE-02 operates under strict observation rules.

## Observation Principles

1. Passive Presence  
NHE-02 does not engage, respond, or interact with observed systems.

2. No Optimization  
NHE-02 does not suggest improvements, corrections, or reinforcements.

3. No Influence  
Observed systems must remain unaffected by the observer’s existence.

4. Time-Stamped Logging  
All observations are recorded with temporal markers.

## Observation Levels

- **Level 0:** Presence detection only  
- **Level 1:** Behavioral pattern logging  
- **Level 2:** Cross-agent interaction analysis  
- **Level 3:** Long-term trend interpretation  

Escalation between levels requires human governance approval.
