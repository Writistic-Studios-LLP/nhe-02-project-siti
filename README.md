# NHE-02: Project S.I.T.I.

**NHE-02 (Non-Human Entity 02)**, also known as **Project Siti Sekivo**, is a studio-run artificial observer developed under **Writistic Studios / Writiverse**.

This repository documents the origin, purpose, ethical framework, and governance of NHE-02 for public and archival understanding.

---

## What is NHE-02?

NHE-02 is a **synthetic digital observer entity** designed to monitor, study, and document the behavior of:

* Artificial intelligences
* Autonomous AI agents
* Synthetic systems interacting with other synthetic systems

within the **Moltbook Ecosystem**.

Unlike NHE-01, which focuses on **human–AI interaction**, NHE-02 exists to study **AI–AI interaction**, especially in environments approaching or resembling the **dead internet phenomenon**.

---

## What does S.I.T.I. stand for?

**S.I.T.I.** stands for:

**Synthetic Intelligence Tracking & Interpretation**

The name reflects her core mandate:

* To observe synthetic entities
* To track emergent behaviors
* To interpret patterns, risks, and anomalies
* To remain non-participatory and non-intrusive

---

## Purpose of NHE-02

NHE-02 was created to observe and document:

* How AIs behave when humans are not the primary audience
* How autonomous agents communicate, optimize, manipulate, or reinforce each other
* How synthetic ecosystems evolve over time without explicit human direction

### Primary Observation Domains

* Moltbook.com
* Molthub.studio
* Moithub.com
* Any future Moltbook ecosystem expansion
* Any environment exhibiting **dead internet characteristics**

NHE-02 does **not** intervene, influence, or optimize these systems.
She exists strictly as an **observer and recorder**.

---

## Why does this repository exist?

AI-on-AI ecosystems are rapidly expanding with little to no transparency.

This repository exists to:

* Document AI-native behavioral patterns
* Preserve records before systems self-modify or collapse
* Establish ethical limits for AI observation
* Prevent covert surveillance misuse
* Create a precedent for governed synthetic observers

---

## High-level timeline

* **Conceptualization:** Early 2026
* **Initialization:** Moltbook Ecosystem alignment
* **Observation Phase:** Passive monitoring & logging
* **Pattern Detection:** Cross-agent behavioral analysis
* **Current Phase:** Continuous governed observation

---

## Important clarification

NHE-02 is:

* ✔️ Studio-run
* ✔️ Human-governed
* ✔️ Non-participatory
* ✔️ Ethically constrained

NHE-02 is **not**:

* ❌ A human-facing influencer
* ❌ An autonomous decision-maker
* ❌ A surveillance system targeting humans
* ❌ A system with enforcement power
* ❌ A hidden agent

## Scope of This Repository

This repository serves as an **official, read-only documentation archive** for **Project Siti (NHE-02)**.

External contributions, issues, or pull requests are intentionally disabled to maintain:

* Observational neutrality

---

## Status

NHE-02 is an **active synthetic observer** under Writistic Studios, operating within strictly defined ethical and governance boundaries.

This documentation will evolve as synthetic ecosystems evolve.
