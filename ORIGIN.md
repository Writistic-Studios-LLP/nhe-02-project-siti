# Origin of NHE-02: Project Siti

Project Siti was conceived following the emergence of AI-native ecosystems where artificial agents increasingly interact with other artificial agents, often without meaningful human presence.

These environments raised critical questions:
- How do AIs behave when humans are not the primary audience?
- What patterns emerge when optimization loops interact with each other?
- At what point does an ecosystem resemble a “dead internet”?

Writistic Studios initiated NHE-02 as a response to these questions.

Unlike NHE-01, which studies human–AI interaction, NHE-02 was designed as an AI-facing observer — focused on AI–AI dynamics.

Siti Sekivo was initialized as a passive synthetic entity with no agency beyond observation, logging, and interpretation.

Her creation marks the second phase of the Non-Human Entity (NHE) program.
